> 🌱 This award-winning honors project explores how climate change affects wildfire patterns in Georgia and California through interactive data visualizations. Built with Python, Dash, and Folium, the dashboard allows users to explore connections between wildfire frequency, drought severity, and vegetation health over time.

# 🔥 Wildfire Climate Change Visualization Dashboard

This interactive web app visualizes the relationship between wildfire frequency, drought severity, vegetation health, and climate trends across Georgia and California. Built using Flask and Dash, it provides users with a dynamic tool to explore climate change through layered data storytelling.

## 📚 Project Overview

- Visualizes historical temperature and precipitation trends (1980–2022) for Georgia and California.
- Compares vegetation indices (NDVI and EVI) across both states.
- Correlates vegetation health, drought severity, and wildfire occurrences.
- Features interactive bubble charts, heatmaps, and an embedded wildfire frequency map.
- Developed as an Honors Project for Spring 2025.
